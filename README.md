# PDM - Python Development Master

A modern Python package manager with PEP 582 support.

## What is PDM?

PDM is meant to be a next generation Python package management tool.
It is originally built for personal interest. If you feel you are going well
with `Pipenv` or `Poetry` and don't want to introduce another package manager,
just stick to it. But if you are missing something that is not present in those tools,
you can probably find some goodness in `pdm`.

## Usage

`python -m pdm --help` should be a good guidance.
