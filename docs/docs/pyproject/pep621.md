# PEP 621 Project metadata

PDM reads the project's metadata following the standardized format of [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/).
View the PEP for the detailed specification. These metadata are stored in `[project]` table of `pyproject.toml`.

_In the following part of this document, metadata should be written under `[project]` table if not given explicitly._

## Determine the package version dynamically

You can specify a file source for `version` field like: `version = {from = "pdm/__init__.py"}`, in this form,
the version will be read from the `__version__` variable in that file.

PDM can also read version from SCM tags. If you are using git or hg as the version control system, define the
`version` as follows:

```toml
version = {use_scm = true}
```

In either case, you MUST also include `version` in `dynamic` field, or the backend will raise an error:

```toml
dynamic = ["version"]
```

## Dependency specification

The `project.dependencies` is an array of dependency specification strings following the [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/)
and [PEP 508](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/).

Examples:

```toml
dependencies = [
    # Named requirement
    "requests",
    # Named requirement with version specifier
    "flask >= 1.1.0",
    # Requirement with environment marker
    "pywin32; sys_platform == 'win32'",
    # URL requirement
    "pip @ https://github.com/pypa/pip.git@20.3.1"
]
```

## Editable requirement

Beside of the normal dependency specifications, one can also have some packages installed in editable mode. The editable specification string format
is the same as [Pip's editable install mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs).

Examples:

```
dependencies = [
    ...,
    "-e path/to/SomeProject",
    "-e git+http://repo/my_project.git#egg=SomeProject"
]
```

!!! note "About editable installation"
    One can have editable installation and normal installation for the same package. The one that comes at last wins.
    However, editable dependencies WON'T be included in the metadata of the built artifacts since they are not valid
    PEP 508 strings. They only exist for development purpose.

## Optional dependencies

You can have some requirements optional, which is similar to `setuptools`' `extras_require` parameter.

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
socks = [ 'PySocks >= 1.5.6, != 1.5.7, < 2' ]
tests = [
  'ddt >= 1.2.2, < 2',
  'pytest < 6',
  'mock >= 1.0.1, < 4; python_version < "3.4"',
]
```

To install a group of optional dependencies:

```bash
$ pdm install -s socks
```

`-s` option can be given multiple times to include more than one group.

## Console scripts

The following content:

```toml
[project.scripts]
mycli = "mycli.__main__:main"
```

will be translated to `setuptools` style:

```python
entry_points = {
    'console_scripts': [
        'mycli=mycli.__main__:main'
    ]
}
```

Also, `[project.gui-scripts]` will be translated to `gui_scripts` entry points group in `setuptools` style.

## Entry points

Other types of entry points are given by `[project.entry-points.<type>]` section, with the same
format of `[project.scripts]`:

```toml
[project.entry-points.pytest11]
myplugin = "mypackage.plugin:pytest_plugin"
```
