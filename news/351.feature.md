- Move `dev-dependencies`, `includes`, `excludes` and `package-dir` out from `[project]` table to `[tool.pdm]` table.
- The migration will be done automaticaly if old format is detected.
- dev-dependencies is now a table of dependencies groups, where key is the group name and value is an array of dependencies. These dependencies won't appear in the distribution's metadata.
- dev-depedencies of the old format will turn into `dev` group under `dev-dependencies`.
- Add a special value `:all` given to `-s/--section` to refer to all sections under the same species.
- Adjust `add`, `sync`, `install`, `remove` and `update` to support the new `dev-dependencies` groups. Old behavior will be kept the same.
