`pdm/installers/installers.py` is renamed to `pdm/installers/manager.py` to be more accurate. The `Installer` class under that file is renamed to `InstallerManager` and is exposed in the `pdm.core.Core` object for overriding. The new `pdm/installers/installers.py` contains some installation implementations.
